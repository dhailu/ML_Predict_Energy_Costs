# ML_Predict_and-_Reduce_Energy_Costs
“Develop a machine learning model to forecast energy consumption and detect anomalies across properties, enabling proactive optimization of HVAC and utilities, and reducing energy costs by _%.”


# Specific ML Objectives

Forecasting

Predict daily/weekly/monthly energy usage (kWh, gas, water).

Anticipate peak demand times to optimize load balancing.

Anomaly Detection

Identify unusual spikes in energy usage (e.g., leaks, faulty equipment).

Flag properties with abnormal consumption patterns compared to peers.

Optimization Insights

Recommend adjustments to HVAC/lights schedules.

Suggest upgrades or preventive actions when certain equipment shows inefficiency trends.
